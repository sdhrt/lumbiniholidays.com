  description: `The Sunkoshi means "Golden River' flows through the great valley between the Mahabharat lekh mountains & Himalayan. It forms the watershed for most of Eastern Nepal, gathering strength from many glaciers fed tributaries on its way to India & the Ganges. Rafting the Sunkoshi River is a unique experience, a rare combination of scenic beauty, cultural encounters & exciting white water. So, Sunkoshi is one of the most enjoyable rivers in the world. Rafting put-in point is Dolalghat, which is just two hours drive from Kathmandu to take-out point at Chatara far down in the Gangetic plain (8 days on the river ). The Sunkoshi starts off fairly relaxed, with small class two rapids & small class three rapids to warm up on during the 1st couple of days. While the lower sections of large volume rivers are usually flat, the Sunkoshi reserves some of its biggest & best rapids for the last days. Everyday 5 hours paddling on the river except first & last day rapid countered class 4 to 5 according`,
