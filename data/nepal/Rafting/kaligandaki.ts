The Kali Gandaki passes through narrow gorges, alongside tumbling waterfalls and jungle, traditional Magar and Chetri villages, whose inhabitants often venture down to the riverside to meet the rafters with traditional 'Namaste!'. There are superb opportunities to see the Annapurna Mountain range and a variety of wildlife and temples on River banks. A total of 105 km covered in four days with excellent white water, and magnificent mountain views of the Annapurna South, the Fishtail Peak and Machhapuchhre." * 5 days * mountain views * Grade 4 / 5 rapids.
