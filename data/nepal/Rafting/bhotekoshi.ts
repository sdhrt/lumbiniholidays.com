The Bhote Koshi is one of the best white water adventures in Nepal (class 4 to 5). Your journey to the starting point takes you through the mountains, past a vista of traditional Tibetan life. Once you're on the river, though there is no time to stop and admire the scenery, as you and your fellow rafters negotiate some of the fastest and steepest rapids in Nepal. This true adventure can be rafted between October and December and February and April.
