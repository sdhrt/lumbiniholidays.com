  description: `Lumbini is the place where Prince Siddhartha (known as Buddha) was born. It is said that here the newly born Prince took his first seven steps and uttered an epoch making message to the suffering humanity. This happened in a beautiful sal grove, which is now the focal point of the Lumbini Garden area. Maya Devi, the queen of Shakya King Suddhodhana of Kapilvastu, while passing through the Lumbini Garden, on the day of "Vaisakha Poornimia" (Full Moon of May 623 B.C.) took a bath in the Pushkarini (the Sacred Pond) and soon after she took support of a tree branch, then gave birth to the crown Prince Siddhartha, who became Buddha. The Lumbini Garden covers an area of 1Ã—3 sq. miles (2.56 sq.km) and encompasses three zones each covering one square mile connected with walkways and canal. The area has a sub tropical monsoon climate with a warm wet season.`,
