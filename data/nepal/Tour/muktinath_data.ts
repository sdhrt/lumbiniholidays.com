  description: `A Jomsom - Muktinath trek (North of Pokhara) reveals Nepal's spectacular diversity at its finest. The deep valleys, high mountains and subtropical jungle to a high, dry landscape resembling the Tibetan Plateau.  It's also among the tamest areas, with excellent lodges lining the main routes. Muktinath is a sacred place for both Hindus and Buddhists located in Muktinath Valley at an altitude of 3,710 meters at the foot of the Thorong La mountain pass (part of the Himalayas) in Mustang, Nepal. The site is close to the village of Ranipauwa, which is sometimes mistakenly called Muktinath.`,
