  description: `
A bus drive to Dhunche (105 Km), north east of Kathmandu, brings you to the starting point of this spectacular Langtang trek to the awesome Langtang valley region of central Nepal ( North of Kathmandu). Moving up a gentle gradient, you pass along the dramatic ridges, through villages inhabited by the Tibetan, Tamang and Sherpa people, into lush forest of Rhododendron, conifers and oak, and passed mountain cattle grazing on rich alpine pastures under the watchful eyes of their herders. Breathtaking Mountain views immerge on your ascent as the vegetation becomes sparser and the conditions more challenging. Once you enter the mail Langtang valley from Ghora Tabala you will find the fluttering Buddies prayer flags in the main trails, brightly painted chortens, Mani walls ( carved Tibetan mantra Om Mani Padme Hum!) and yak herders welcome you to the land of these high mountain people. Langtang Lirung, Langshisa, Ganjala Peaks proudly show above as you head for the main Langtang and Kanjing trail. This adventure takes you off the bitten track into the valley of a hardy, untouched people. You will have enough time to explore and relax in Kathmandu.`,
