        <span>Namaste!!!</span>

        <span>
          It has been a great pleasure to introduce our company organization,
          THE LUMBINI HOLIDAYS TOURS & TRAVELS (P) LTD, a service-oriented
          company founded by a group of experienced travel and tourism
          professionals.
        </span>

        <span>
          As we work on this field site, we hope you will find it useful and
          that it will provide you with all the necessary tourism information
          about Nepal and its neighboring countries.
        </span>

        <span>
          All the itineraries included on this site are fully tried and tested.
          Some of these programs are completely new concepts developed after
          years of experience and have been found suitable for all age groups.
          We are confident that our efforts will translate into higher-quality
          business soon.
        </span>

        <span>
          Considering the interests of the majority of visitors to Nepal, we
          have focused our tours around natural and cultural sites rather than
          urban locations. In most of the itineraries we offer, we aim to
          minimize our clients' stay in Kathmandu city, transferring them
          instead to one of the many luxury hill resorts around Kathmandu valley
          & RIM, except in the case of late arrivals or early departures.
        </span>

        <span>
          We have also introduced a few well-researched incentives and
          convention tourism programs amidst the splendor of luxury hotels
          throughout Nepal with soft adventure options. The positive feedback we
          have received from visitors who have experienced these motivational
          holidays in the past is very gratifying. Both Kathmandu and Pokhara
          offer international-standard hotels with convention and meeting
          facilities, catering to this highly specialized market segment.
        </span>

        <span>
          Nepal has opened its skies to private airlines and helicopter
          services. As a result, the natural beauty of the high Himalayas, which
          were once quite inaccessible and required weeks of strenuous trekking,
          are now within easy reach for visitors coming to Nepal. This allows us
          to offer exciting high-altitude treks.
        </span>

        <span>
          Nepal is also the natural gateway to many other exotic destinations
          such as TIBET, BHUTAN, SIKKIM, DARJEELING, LADAKH, as well as Hong
          Kong, Malaysia, Bangkok, Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, and the Middle East.
          We have included tours to these regions either in conjunction with
          Nepal or as a short stopover in Kathmandu with convenient connections.
          There is no doubt that this entire region can now be marketed as a
          single destination. Our tour programs can be customized to meet your
          specific requirements. Please let us know how we can assist in
          planning your travel needs.
